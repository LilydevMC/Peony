Peony can build Minecraft mods and modpacks, release them to both GitHub Releases and Modrinth,
and optionally, send a Discord webhook after release.

## Todo
You can find a very limited todo list [here](/TODO.md).
This may be moved to GitHub issues in the future, but I find regular Markdown files easier to work with.
